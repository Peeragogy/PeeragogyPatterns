\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:Case Studies}

\subsection{Wikimedia projects.}

\patternname{Newcomer} There are lots of resources newcomers can use, including
the ``Teahouse'', and lots of documentation.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Teahouse}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Editing}}  They may be rewarded for their efforts with a special ``barnstar''.\footnote{\url{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Exceptional_newcomer.jpg}}
Newcomer ``survival'' is of interest to the Wikimedia foundation.\footnote{\url{https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Newcomer_survival_models}}

\patternname{Reduce, reuse, recycle} On the \emph{upstream} side,
users are encouraged to recycle existing works that are compatible
with the CC-By-SA license and the mission of the respective sites.  On
the \emph{downstream} side, DBPedia is huge in semantic web.  There
have been some other interesting experimental projects e.g. for
building learning paths through Wikipedia content, or showing heatmaps
of editing activity -- these aren't made that accessible to day-to-day
users.

\patternname{Wrapper} There are lots of blogs and feeds that can be
used to stay informed.  However, one aspect of this that could be
improved is the issue, mentioned above, with getting access to the
latest experiments.  Wikimedia as a community seems to be good at
building resources, but not always giving exposure to contributors.

\patternname{Roadmap} The \emph{Help} tab occupies a piece of prime
real estate (it is on every Wikipedia page).  It may be useful for
newcomers, but it could also provides a sort of roadmap for the user's
engagement.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Contents}}

\begin{quotation}
\noindent 
I want to read or find an article;
I want to edit an article;
I want to report a problem with an article;
I want to create a new article or upload media;
I have a factual question.
(etc.)
\end{quotation}

However, many people will bypass help functions.A recent post from
Jonathan Morgan of WMF talks about \emph{outlines} at the article
level, which would give some insight into an article-level
``roadmap.''

\begin{quotation}
\noindent Cross-posting this request to the {\tt wiki-research-l} mailing
list. Anyone have data on frequently used section titles in articles
(any language), or know of datasets/publications that examined this?

One may have to turn to the research literature to give an idea of
current global coverage of Wikipedia \cite{holloway2007analyzing}.
Plans exist at the level of individual projects (below) and for the
Wikimedia Foundation as a whole.

\patternname{A specific project} One of the best ways to connect with
other users is to join a specific
WikiProject.\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Directory}}\textsuperscript{,}\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Guide}}
Individual projects often maintain their own lists of articles to add.
 
\patternname{Heartbeat} The yearly in-person gathering, Wikimania,
provides the clearest example of heartbeat for the Wikimedia movement.
This is one way in which Wikipedia functions as a social network. 
Another relevant feature is the twice-yearly call for for proposals for
individual engagement grants.\footnote{\url{https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IEG}}

\patternname{Scrapbook} - we could reference the previous ``five year
plan'' as a sort of scrapbook.

\patternname{Carrying capacity} 
%``we are often blinded
%by our ... preferences'' -- In everything that's written here, there
%are certain phrases that I especially respond to.
%
%% Buzzwords or things that are relevant, things that feel useful --
%% through these statements, I feel a connection, can start to plug in.
%% If you had a paper like this, and each person could log in, and
%% highlight the lines they liked, they might find out how much they
%% resonated with other people with similar interests and concerns--
%% there are many issues there and many ways to plug in.
%
%re the five pillars of wikipedia: number 2 neutrality.
Wikipedia may be neutral, but we're not neutral.
%
%% the phrase "objective understanding" doesn't mean you don't care,
%% it just means that you know what you care about!  CD: Independent
%% news sources can get this really twisted.  MH: "I'm not neutral
%% about children's lives."  "Because if we don't they are in
%% trouble."
%
%% ``Objective'' means to push off of -- we know what we want and what
%% we don't want.  If you want to guard the kids, then you, as a person,
%% can see 10000 things that might go wrong -- although you don't have
%% to think about each of the 10000 things We're not bullshitting, we're
%% talking about things that matter to us!  
%
Wikipedia is important because it is relevant to things that matter to
us.  It helps to inform us regarding our necessary purposes -- and we
are invited to ``speak up'' by making edits to pages that matter to
us.
%
%% re: number 4:ethics. yes. ethics means civil solutions. As in
%% peaceably, agreeably as humanly possible, not violently.

\patternname{Peeragogy} - Users are invited to contribute content as
well as software, and can get involved with governance and other
``meta'' duties.  The Wikimedia Foundation runs one the
7\textsuperscript{th} most popular website, and has around 230
employees.  For comparison, the 6\textsuperscript{th} most popular
website is Amazon, with more than 150K employees, and the
8\textsuperscript{th} most popular website is run by Tencent Holdings
Limited, with around 30K employees.

% Ladies Hall, South Dormitory, University Hall, Assembly Halls \& Library, North Dormitory, Science Hall, President's Residence, University Farm, and Washburn Observatory.
\subsection{The future university.}
As a design exercise, it is useful to compare and contrast the
patterns we have introduced with the typical or stereotypical image of
a university from Figure \ref{madison-map}.  Most likely we would have
little use for a separate Ladies Hall, for ``there shall be no women
in case there be not men, nor men in case there be not women''
\cite[Chapter 1.LII]{rabelais1894gargantua}.  However, in light of the
current extreme gender imbalance in free software, it is important to
do whatever it takes to make women and girls welcome, not least
because this is a significant factor in boosting our
\patternname{Carrying capacity}.  Dormitories may be seen as as an
optional extra, since studying from where you live is an option.
However, cooperatively-owned living/working spaces may frequently be
an asset for \patternname{A specific project}.  In-person meetings for
special-purpose assemblies (e.g., for conventions, dances, and
commencement ceremonies) could comprise an important part of the
project's \patternname{Wrapper}.  One of the most noticeable things
about ``now'' is that we have a vast array of resources available
online.  Indeed, this may be the most significant factor in making the
future university conceivable.  However, these resources are not
always as organized as they would need to be for serious educative
purposes, so putting effort into \patternname{Reduce, reuse, and
  recycle}'ing them is one place where peeragogues could usefully
apply effort.  It will often make sense to connect learning as a
research \patternname{Newcomer} to part-time or future employment, so
that the future university may see a closer coupling of science and
industry.  We have no need to maintain a special president's
residence, although it would be nice to have a place to throw parties
and work collaboratively on the project's \patternname{Roadmap} and
\patternname{Scrapbook}.  One or more working farms could be useful to
help physically sustain peeragogues, while putting the project's
\patternname{Heartbeat} in tune with that of the seasons.  And as for
an observatory, that is also important, if \patternname{Peeragogy} is
truly to reach \emph{ad astra, per aspera}.
