\section{Peeragogy}\label{sec:Peeragogy_Project}
% DK: I question whether the Peeragogy Project is a pattern, or an instance of a pattern. We generally think about patterns as something that can be instantiated. But your project seems like a specific case of the concept.

\subsubsection*{Context}  Architectual maverick Christopher Alexander asked the following questions to an audience of computer programmers \cite{alexander1999origins}: 
\begin{quote}
``What is the Chartres of programming? What task is at a high enough level to inspire people writing programs, to reach for the stars?''
\end{quote}
In order for humanity to pull itself up by its bootstraps, on this planet or any other, we need to continue to learn and adapt.  Computers can help accelerate this process.  In particular, collaborative projects like Wikipedia, StackExchange, and Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) represent an implicit challenge to the old ``industrial'' organization of work, and the work of education in particular.  In the context of these free, open, post-modern organizations, not only are individual participants learning and growing, but they can contribute to adapting the methods and infrastructure as they go.

\subsubsection*{Problem} What is the real potential of this new way of organizing the human life-world?  Simply creating a free/open piece of software does not mean that other people will get involved: in fact, the majority of free software projects fail to attract users or contributing developers.  Even a successful project like Wikipedia is a work in progress that can be adapted to \emph{better} empower and engage people around the world, to develop \emph{richer} and more useful educational content, and to deploy it \emph{more creatively}.  How to go about this is a difficult question, and we don't know the answers in advance.

\subsubsection*{Solution} \emph{Peeragogy} is our word for the process whereby different people involved with different projects can describe material problems, share practical solutions and works-in-progress.   There are many different ways to go about this -- bug reports, mailing lists, writers workshops, and Q\&A forums are all places where peeragogy can happen.  The integration of a wide range of ideas and inputs are supported by, but do not require, internet access.  We have found that the reflection part of the process is particularly well-matched to Christopher Alexander's idea of a \emph{pattern language}, in which commonly occurring  interconnect elements of an optative design are described in terms of a simple template.  Indeed, thought of as a design pattern, \patternname{Peeragogy} can be understood as an up-to-date revision of Alexander's \patternname{Network of Learning} \cite[p. 99]{alexander1977pattern}.  It \emph{decentralizes the process of learning and enriches it through contact with many places and people} -- in interconnected networks that can reach all over the world.   Importantly, while people involved in a peeragogical process may be collaborating on \patternname{A Specific Project}, they don't have to be direct collaborators outside of the learning context or co-located in time or space.  Peeragogy often takes place in mostly-horizontal relationships between people who have different but compatible objectives.  

\subsubsection*{Rationale}
% DK: I have written many, and shepherded many more, and I donâ€™t think this is the case. However, the effort that goes into writing them makes them more intuitive to read :+)
``Patterns'' can be shared in different ways, and finding better ways to express and share them is the important thing (\emph{NB.}~\cite{meszaros1998pattern} describe common patterns involved in the creation of \emph{design patterns} per se).  The main point is that we can navigate the underlying dynamics better when we understand them.  When we're able to share our learning process fluidly with others, this expands the range of perspectives and can produce new insights.  Peeragogy weds Alexander's vision of a programmer's cathedral to Eric Raymond's vision of the corresponding open source bazaar \cite{raymond2001cathedral} -- and opens the doors to non-programmers.
% Our earlier draft: Well-written design patterns is intuitive to read.  The process of finding and writing good design patterns is more involved, but we can be guided by an intuitive sense of what works.
% DK. I am not quite sure what you mean by this: We can use our design pattern catalog to scaffold our work on other parts of the project -- our technical platform, our Handbook, our meetings -- and to connect with others.  

\subsubsection*{Resolution}
%% Our earlier draft: Writing down this pattern defines some of the key terms for \patternname{Newcomers}, and shows how to use the pattern template introduced schematically above.  Together with Figure \ref{fig:connections}, this pattern begins to show how we are affected by using patterns to build emergent structure.
% DK: I think this misses the point of the Resolution. How did Peeragogy resolve the forces that made the problem challenging? Are the participants better off for having used Peeragogy?
Peeragogy helps people in different projects describe and solve real problems.  This can guide action in ways that we wouldn't have seen on our own.

\begin{framed}
\noindent \emph{What's next.} We intend to revise and extend the patterns and methods of peeragogy to make it a workable model for education.
\end{framed}
