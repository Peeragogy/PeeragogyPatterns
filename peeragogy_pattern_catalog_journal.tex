\begin{abstract}
We describe nine design patterns that we have developed in our work on the Peeragogy project, in which we aim to help design the future of learning, inside and outside of institutions, drawing on the principles of free/libre/open source software and open culture.  We use these patterns to build an ``emergent roadmap'' for the project.  Our use of design patterns has some novel features that will be relevant to others working in projects with emergent structure.

%% \section{``Peeragogy'' or ``Paragogy''?}

%% First, an etymological fragment:

%% \begin{quotation}
%% The prefix \emph{para-} meaning beside is Greek, and the prefix \emph{para-}
%% meaning \emph{against} is French, stemming from the Latin word \emph{parare} (to
%% make ready) unrelated to the Greek \emph{para-}. No shift of meaning, just a
%% coincidence.\footnote{Peter Shor, at \url{http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/54673/why-is-para-not-used-consistently}}
%% \end{quotation}

%% Another (rather convenient) coincidence: ``paragogy'' is an existing
%% Greek word, meaning production.  I've always liked the implied double
%% meaning that paragogy was about both ``peer learning'' and
%% ``production.''  The gloss ``peer produced peer learning'' puts the
%% main emphasis on \emph{learning}, and with ``peeragogy'' the
%% dual-language pun is gone entirely.  Still, it would be good if
%% the ``production'' aspects got fair play.  With these comments in
%% mind, consider:

%% \begin{quotation}
%% Opposition can be the law of the relation between abstract products,
%% but difference is the only principle of genesis or production; a
%% principle which itself produces opposition as a mere appearance.
%% Dialectic thrives on oppositions because it is unaware of far more
%% subtle and subterranean differential mechanisms. \citeadx[p. 157]{deleuze2006nietzsche}
%% \end{quotation}

%% Here we have ``para-'' in both its Greek and its Latin forms, opposed
%% but in a particularly subtle way.  Gilles Deleuze is saying that
%% ``thesis/antithesis/synthesis'' isn't how consciousness comes into
%% being \citeadx[p. 34]{hughes2009deleuze}.  Rather, it is as if consciousness and
%% being itself feels its way forward, distinguishing the present from
%% the past, creating new forms and re-creating individual beings as it goes.  So
%% another very philosophical way to read the word ``paragogy'' would be
%% to think of this Deleuze quote and our participation in the genesis of
%% being!

%% \section{Patterns and dynamics}

%% With regard to the design pattern catalog, we are not just thinking of
%% \emph{abstract} patterns, but patterns that are contingent on what we
%% do, and patterns that -- as we distinguish them -- shape who we are.
%% The way we use design patterns  ``constitutes and occupies practical or
%% speculative problems as such'' \citeadx[p. 204]{deleuze1994difference} -- and in Deleuze's construction, this is what defines learning.  Something of along the lines of this dynamical view
%% is developed by Christian Kohls in
%% \citeadx{kohls2010structure,kohls2011structure}, but in a less
%% ``embedded'' manner.
