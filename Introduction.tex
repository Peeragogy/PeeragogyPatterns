\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

Readers will have encountered \emph{peer production}, at least in applications like Wikipedia, StackExchange, and free/libre/open source software development.  In this paper we apply design patterns to understand the human side of this kind of socio-technical development.  In the Peeragogy project,  we aim to build upon these inspiring examples to help design the future of education.  
We have found design patterns tremendously useful for organizing our thinking about these matters.  However, there is a key difference between our pattern catalog and previous collections of design patterns that touch on similar domains -- like \emph{Liberating Voices: A Pattern Language for Communication Revolution} \cite{schuler2008liberating} and \emph{Pedagogical Patterns: Advice for Educators} \cite{bergin2012pedagogical}.

Our pattern catalog is our primary project management tool -- our way of ``synthesizing form'' \cite{alexander1964notes} in the Peeragogy project. A quite convincing implementation of Christopher Alexanderâ€™s idea of patterns as a ``living language'' \cite[p.~xvii]{alexander1977pattern} was realized with one of the earliest applications of wiki software developed by Ward Cunningham: the Portland Pattern Repository.  What we've developed is a further iteration of this idea.   As they developed, some of the patterns made an appearance at a PhD thesis defense \cite{corneli-thesis}, and the pattern template was revised and revised again, until ultimately we settled on something fairly traditional.  At the level of the template, one innovation is to add a ``What's next'' step to each pattern, which anticipates the way the pattern will continue to ``resolve'' in the context of our project. 

At a more philosophical level, our approach is all about human interaction, and the challenges, fluidity and lack of predictability that comes with it.  Something that works for one person may not work for another or may not even work for the same person in a slightly different situation.  It is easy to say ``just do X'' and somewhat easy for reasonable people to agree in general terms about what to do.  In our view, other pattern languages frequently achieve this sort of common sense rationality, but then they stop.  In our experience, failure in the prescriptive model begins when people start trying to define things more carefully, make context-specific changes; when they actually try to put ideas into practice, or understand things in a more tangible way. The patterns we introduce here describe ways to negotiate the execution and implementation of solutions in their practical context.  This often requires compromise, adjustments and even restarts.  

So, while we speak the same language as other developers of design patterns, our orientation is somewhat different, and our understanding of the word `pattern' is nuanced because we aim to take full account of the lifecycle of patterns.  We believe this gets to the heart of what design patterns can do.  We are not just thinking of \emph{abstract} patterns, but patterns that are contingent on what we do, and patterns that -- as we distinguish them -- shape who we are.   We believe that design patterns can be used to ``constitute and occupy practical or speculative problems as such'' and that this is precisely what defines learning \cite[p. 204]{deleuze1994difference}.   Something of along the lines of this dynamical view
is developed by Christian Kohls in \cite{kohls2010structure,kohls2011structure}, but in a less ``embedded'' manner.

The result of this effort is a hands-on adjunct to existing sociological and historical research on peer production, surveyed in \cite{benkler2015peer}.  In practical terms, we believe the patterns that we introduce here will be useful for students and educators who want their work to have real-world relevance, to activists and policy-makers who want to develop practicable solutions to large-scale problems, and to employees and managers who, like it or not, find themselves working in distributed teams.   Our approach to emergent organization will also be of interest to theorists of social interaction in fields like organization studies and, increasingly, computer science.  The next section introduces \patternname{Peeragogy} more explicitly in the form of a design pattern.  Sections \ref{sec:Roadmap}--\ref{sec:Scrapbook} list the main patterns in our catalog.    Figure \ref{fig:connections} illustrates their interconnections.  Section \ref{sec:Distributed_Roadmap} collects our ``What's next'' steps and summarizes the outlook of our project.
