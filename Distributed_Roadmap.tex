\section{Distributed Roadmap} \label{sec:Distributed_Roadmap}

\begin{quote}
This section reprises the ``What's Next'' steps in all the previous
patterns, offering another view on the project \patternname{Roadmap}
in its emergent form.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Peeragogy_Project]{Peeragogy}} 
 We intend to revise and extend the patterns and methods of peeragogy to make it a workable model for education.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Roadmap]{Roadmap}} If we sense that something needs to change about the project, that is a clue that we might need to record a new pattern.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Use_or_make]{Reduce, Reuse, Recycle}}
We've spun off the pattern catalog from the \emph{Peeragogy Handbook} into this paper, sharing it with a new community and gaining new perspectives.  Let's look for other parts of the handbook we can spin off!

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Carrying_capacity]{Carrying capacity}} 
Making it easy and fruitful for others to get involved is one of the best ways to
redistribute the load (compare the
\patternname{\href{http://peeragogy.org/practice/heuristics/newcomer/}{Newcomer}}
pattern).

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:A_specific_project]{A specific project}}
We need to build specific, tangible ``what's next'' steps and connect them with concrete action. The \patternname{Pattern Audit Routine} can help operationalize that process. 

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Wrapper]{Wrapper}}  We need better practices for automating the wrapping-up process. One of the latest ideas is to develop a simple visual ``dashboard'' for the project that would be a web page people could access and immediately get an idea of what work is ongoing in the project with links for going more in depth and/or contributing.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Heartbeat]{Heartbeat}} Identifying and fostering new \patternname{Heartbeats} and new working groups is a task that can help make the community more robust.  This is the temporal dimension of spin off projects described in \patternname{Use or Make}.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Creating_a_guide]{Creating a guide}}
Working with our shepherd at PLoP to improve this paper!

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Newcomer]{Newcomer}} A more detailed (but non-limiting) ``How to Get Involved'' walk-through in text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing some of the things we're learning about.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Pattern_Audit_Routine]{Pattern Audit Routine}} Regularly go through the \patternname{Pattern Audit Routine} in our future meetings.

\subsubsection*{\hyperref[sec:Scrapbook]{Scrapbook}} After significantly pruning back the pattern catalog, we want it to grow again: new patterns are needed.  Reviewing the contents of the \patternname{Scrapbook} will be one place to look for inspiration, but there are others.
