\section{Newcomer}\label{sec:Newcomer}

\subsubsection*{Context}
A lot of ``education'' assumes we are speaking to a new generation. 
In learning more broadly, the ``audience'' is typically new to the topic or some aspect of the topic.
Sometimes we are the \patternname{Newcomers}, sometimes we're the oldtimers.

\subsubsection*{Problem} \patternname{Newcomers} can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn.  They
don't know where to start.  They may have a bunch of ideas that the
oldtimers have never considered -- or they may think they have new
ideas, which are actually a different take on old ideas; see
\patternname{Reduce, Reuse, Recycle}.

\subsubsection*{Solution} It is good to try to become aware of what a
\patternname{Newcomer} needs, and what their motivations are.  They may ask naive questions, which
should be met with patient answers, guiding questions, and links to resources.
Moreover, a naive question can be quite sophisticated -- pointing out unrealistic
assumptions on the part of project organisers.  \patternname{Newcomers} themselves
may have only a general idea about what their goals are, so it can be helpful to add
concreteness by nudging them towards work on \patternname{A Specific Project}.

\subsubsection*{Rationale} 
New ideas can prompt us to consider how we may have been limiting ourselves.
If \patternname{Newcomers} complain that they are confused, this is a sign that
the \patternname{Roadmap} has not been made sufficiently clear.  This may not
be a question of detail, but of a clear articulation of the high-level vision.
%% In the words of Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery:
%% ``If you want to build a boat, do not instruct the men to saw wood,
%% stitch the sails, prepare the tools and organize the work,
%% but make them long for setting sail and travel to distant lands.''


\subsubsection*{Resolution}
An awareness of the difficulties that \patternname{Newcomers} face can
help us be more compassionate to ourselves and others.

\emph{What's Next.}
A more detailed (but non-limiting) ``How to Get Involved'' walk-through in text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing some of the things we're learning about, including business issues relevant to the Peeragogy project, how to run a MOOC, hot-syncing our website from Git, etc.
