% DK: I am not sure that this is a Pattern. It is a role for sure, but is it a solution to a problem? Maybe the name of the pattern is wrong. Something like Welcome Wagon? Something that evokes the response to the Newcomer.

\subsubsection*{Context}
% DK: This is an interesting point. I am not sure it is Context. Maybe Rationale?
A lot of ``education'' assumes we are speaking to a new generation. 
In learning more broadly, the ``audience'' is typically new to the topic or some aspect of the topic.
Sometimes we are newcomers, sometimes we are oldtimers.

\subsubsection*{Problem} Newcomers can feel overwhelmed by the amount of things to learn.  They
don't know where to start.  They may have a bunch of ideas that the
oldtimers have never considered -- or they may think they have new
ideas, which are actually a different take on old ideas; see
\patternname{Reduce, reuse, recycle}.

% DK: This seems a little spare
\subsubsection*{Solution} The primary feature of our solution is to shift the
focus to our own experience as newcomers.  It is is good to try to become aware of
what a newcomer needs, and what their motivations are -- but it is even more
effective when we do this in a first person mode rather than a ``provisionist''
mode \cite{boud2005peer}.  Instead of thinking of newcomers as ``them'',
and trying to provide solutions, we focus on newcomers as ``us'' -- which
makes the need for solutions that much more urgent. 
As newcomers, we find ourselves asking naive questions.
Moreover, as newcomers, we often have only a vague idea of what our goals are, so
it can be helpful to add concreteness by nudging ourselves
towards \patternname{A Specific Project}.

% DK: I can empathize :+) I wonder if there is a pattern that is missing. Vision? A clear articulation about what the effort is for
%
\subsubsection*{Rationale} 
When we're open about being newcomers ourselves,
we become much more ready to join total newbies as peers.
It is only when we're ready to learn that new ideas will have meaning.
Confusion on the part of anyone in the project may be a sign that
the \patternname{Roadmap} has not been made sufficiently clear.  This might not
be a question of insufficient detail, but lack of structure.

%% In the words of Antoine de Saint-Exup\'ery:
%% ``If you want to build a boat, do not instruct the men to saw wood,
%% stitch the sails, prepare the tools and organize the work,
%% but make them long for setting sail and travel to distant lands.''

% DK: The resolution should describe the circumstance after applying the solution. This seems to be describe the circumstance without the solution.
\subsubsection*{Resolution}
An awareness of the difficulties that newcomers face can
help us be more compassionate to ourselves and others.  We
become open to new ideas, which can show how we have
been limiting ourselves in the past.

\emph{What's Next.}
A more detailed (but non-limiting) ``How to Get Involved'' walk-through in text or video form would be good to develop. We can start by listing some of the things we're currently learning about, including: business issues relevant to the Peeragogy project, how to run a MOOC, and hot-syncing our website from Git.
