\section{Carrying capacity}\label{sec:Carrying_capacity}
% DK: There is how much you can doâ€¦.and there is how much you can do at once :+)
\subsubsection*{Context} There's only so much any one person can do with limited resources and a limited amount of time.

%DK: To some degree this is a red herring. For virtually all FLOSS projects, there are a small number of contributors and a wide group of users. If that makes you uncomfortable as a contributor, you will never be comfortable.
\subsubsection*{Problem} At times, a facilitator or participant in the
peer-learning enterprise may feel he or she is over-contributing -- or,
perhaps more likely, that others are under-contributing -- or that
someone else is railroading an idea or dominating the discussion.

\subsubsection*{Solution} If this happens, take a step back and observe the
dynamics of involvement. Ask questions and let others
answer. Especially if you start to feel the symptoms of burnout, seek
a more sustainable level of engagement.  Lead by presenting a good
example -- and make sure it's someplace you, and others, actually want
to go!  This could be a good time to revisit the group's
\patternname{Roadmap} and see if you can figure out and clarify to
others what concrete goal you're working towards. Remember that you
can also change the ``landscape'' by making it easier for other people
to get involved -- for example, by explaining what you're trying to do
in a clear manner.  Be on the look out for opportunities to step back,
watch, and listen.  Try to be mindful of phases when active or quiet
involvement would be more helpful to the individual and the group.
It's also helpful to let anyone who has taken on a facilitation role
know if you're stepping back temporarily.  Then, when the time is
right, step back in and get to work!

% DK: This seems to be argument by negation. Can you make a positive argument for the rationale?
\subsubsection*{Rationale} Even though your project may be very important, you
won't always make it go better by working harder.


\subsubsection*{Resolution}
This pattern serves as a good reminder for anyone who believes him- or
herself to be caring more about project outcomes than other
participants.
% DK: This seems like solution. ->
Investigate why this is.  Are you all affected by the
outcomes in the same way?
% DK: This seems like Rationale ->
Working smart requires you to focus on your
own goals, while relating to others who may have a different outlook,
with different, but hopefully still compatible goals.

\subsubsection*{What's Next} This pattern catalog has been rewritten in a way
that should make it easy for anyone to add new patterns. Making it easy
and fruitful for others to get involved is one of the best ways to
redistribute the load (compare
the \patternname{\href{http://peeragogy.org/practice/heuristics/newcomer/}{Newcomer}}
pattern).
