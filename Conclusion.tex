\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}

In thinking about the future of education, it is useful to compare and
contrast the patterns we have introduced with the typical or
stereotypical image of a university from Figure \ref{madison-map}.
Most likely we would have little use for a separate Ladies Hall, for
``there shall be no women in case there be not men, nor men in case
there be not women'' \cite[Chapter 1.LII]{rabelais1894gargantua}.
However, in light of the current extreme gender imbalance in free
software, it is important to do whatever it takes to make women and
girls welcome, not least because this is a significant factor in
boosting our \patternname{Carrying capacity}.  Dormitories may be seen
as as an optional extra, since studying from where you live is an
option.  However, cooperatively-owned living/working spaces may
frequently be an asset for \patternname{A specific project}.
In-person meetings for special-purpose assemblies (e.g., for
conventions, dances, and commencement ceremonies) could comprise an
important part of the project's \patternname{Wrapper}.  One of the
most noticeable things about ``now'' is that we have a vast array of
resources available online.  Indeed, this may be the most significant
factor in making the future university conceivable.  However, these
resources are not always as organized as they would need to be for
serious educative purposes, so putting effort into
\patternname{Reduce, reuse, and recycle}'ing them is one place where
peeragogues could usefully apply effort.  It will often make sense to
connect learning as a research \patternname{Newcomer} to part-time or
future employment, so that the future university may see a closer
coupling of science and industry.  We have no need to maintain a
special president's residence, although it would be nice to have a
place to throw parties and work collaboratively on the project's
\patternname{Roadmap} and \patternname{Scrapbook}.  One or more
working farms could be useful to help physically sustain peeragogues,
while putting the project's \patternname{Heartbeat} in tune with that
of the seasons.  And as for an observatory, that is also important, if
\patternname{Peeragogy} is truly to reach \emph{ad astra, per aspera}.

% organization, motivation, and quality

We close by evaluating the contributions of this paper using an
outline of the key factors in peer production, borrowed from
\cite{benkler2015peer}.

\vspace{-.25\baselineskip}

\subsubsection*{Organization} 
Our project management strategy \emph{decentralizes both goal setting
  and execution} \cite{benkler2015peer}, reintegrating structure in
the form of an emergent \patternname{Roadmap}.  We have aimed to make
our discussion general and our methods extensible enough to work at
varying levels of scale, degrees of formality, and solidity of
organization.

\subsubsection*{Motivation}  As Philipp Schmidt indicates, learning
is at the core of peer production \cite{schmidt+commons-based+2009}.  The future university may be the
Chartes of programming -- but we will build it like a bazaar. ``The
commercial world cannot win an evolutionary arms race with
free-software communities that can put orders of magnitude more
skilled time into a problem'' \cite{raymond2001cathedral}.

\vspace{-.25\baselineskip}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 
``By intervening in real communities, these efforts achieve a level of
external validity that lab-based experiments cannot'' \cite{benkler2015peer}.
The ``What's next'' annotation piloted here may be helpful to other
design pattern authors who want to use their patterns as a research intervention.

%% The potential societal benefits of a free/open/libre approach to

%% collaboration.  However, serious challenges remain.  We envision the
%% Peeragogy project as mutual aid society for other collaborative
%% projects.  And yet, many educators are not eager to collaborate, and
%% many enthusiastic collaborators are not particularly eager to educate.
%% Nonetheless, there are numerous inspiring examples of peeragogy (by
%% any other name) -- ranging from institutional forms like co-op format
%% undergraduate programs to graduate-level or accelerator-sponsored
%% training in entrepreneurship, to more informal collaborations in
%% hacker-maker spaces and other highly diverse coauthoring, critique,
%% and creative groups around the world.

% structuring design changes as experiments

% governance and hierarchies tend to become more pronounced as peer production projects mature

% With habituation and practice, internalized prosocial behaviors may lead people to adopt a more, or less, cooperative stance in specific contexts based on their interpretation of the appropriate social practice and its coherence with their self-understanding of how to live well

% Observational work that estimates the effects of motivational drivers across real communities offers an especially promising avenue for future work.

% By focusing only on the projects that successfully mobilize contributors, researchers interested in when peer production occurs or the reasons why it succeeds at producing high quality outputs have systematically selected on their dependent variables. An important direction for peer production research will be to study these failures.

% Benkler (2006) speculated that peer production may be better at producing functional works like operating system software and encyclopedias than creative works like code or art.

% For example, while experienced editors may perceive low quality contributions from inexperienced editors as a nuisance, “newbie” edits also attract the attention of experienced community members to improve popular pages they might otherwise have ignored
